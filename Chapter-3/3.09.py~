# Problem: You need to perform calculations on large numerical datasets, such
# as arrays or grids.

# numpy provides an array object which more efficient and better suited for
# mathematical calculations than a standard Python list

# Python list
x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [5, 6, 7, 8]
x * 2 # [1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4]
x + 10 # TypeError
x + y # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

# Numpy arrays
import numpy as np
ax = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
ay = np.array([5, 6, 7, 8])
ax * 2 # array([2, 4, 6, 8])
ax + 10 # array([11, 12, 13, 14])
ax + ay # array([6, 8, 10, 12])
ax * ay # array([5, 12, 21, 32])

# scalar operations: apply operations element by element


# The fact that math operations apply to all of the elements simultaneously
# makes it very easy and fast to compute functions across an entire array
