Data Structures and Algorithms

Python provides a variety of useful built-in data structures, such as lists, sets, and dic‚Äê 
tionaries. For the most part, the use of these structures is straightforward. However, 
common questions concerning searching, sorting, ordering, and filtering often arise. Thus, 
the goal of this chapter is to discuss common data structures and algorithms involving data. 
In addition, treatment is given to the various data structures contained in the collections 
module.

1.1 Unpacking a Sequence into Separate Variables     
1.2 Unpacking Elements from Iterables of Arbitrary Length       
1.3 Keeping the Last N Items      
1.4 Finding the Largest or Smallest N Items      
1.5 Implementing a Priority Queue     
1.6 Mapping Keys to Multiple Values in a Dictionary    
1.7 Keeping Dictionaries in Order    
1.8 Calculating with Dictionaries    
1.9 Finding Commonalities in Two Dictionaries    
1.10 Removing Duplicates from a Sequence while Maintaining Order    
1.11 Naming a Slice    
1.12 Determining the Most Frequently Occurring Items in a Sequence    
1.13 Sorting a List of Dictionaries by a Common Key    
1.14 Sorting Objects Without Native Comparison Support    
1.15 Grouping Records Together Based on a Field    
1.16 Filtering Sequence Elements    
1.17 Extracting a Subset of a Dictionary    
1.18 Mapping Names to Sequence Elements    
1.19 Transforming and Reducing Data at the Same Time    
1.20 Combining Multiple Mappings into a Single Mapping
